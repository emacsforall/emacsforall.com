## Why Emacs for All?

Emacs is one of the most powerful and extensible tools ever created, with an active community of hundreds of thousands of users and decades of accumulated wisdom. Yet for something so capable, the learning resources are strangely fragmented — scattered across outdated wiki pages, decade-old blog posts, and dense manual pages that assume you already know what you're looking for.

We believe Emacs deserves better onboarding. The editor has quietly modernized — with tree-sitter, native compilation, LSP integration, and a thriving package ecosystem — but the story hasn't caught up. People still think Emacs is a relic. We're here to change that.

**emacsforall.com** exists to be the resource we wish existed when we started: clear, modern, and welcoming. Free tutorials, real-world workflows, honest guidance on where Emacs shines and where it struggles, and a community that meets people where they are — whether they're migrating from VS Code, curious about org-mode, or ready to build their own editing environment from scratch.

*No gatekeeping. No "read the manual." Just practical paths into one of the most rewarding tools you'll ever learn.*
