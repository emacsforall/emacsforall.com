** DONE Your First Hour in Emacs — Skip the Tutorial, Do This Instead :emacs:beginners:getting_started:
:PROPERTIES:

Most Emacs tutorials start the same way: "Run the built-in tutorial with =C-h t=." We're going to skip that entirely. Instead, let's get you productive in Emacs in under an hour with a modern setup.

#+begin_export hugo
{{< youtube dQw4w9WxXcQ >}}
#+end_export

*** Install Emacs 29+

Make sure you're running Emacs 29 or later — it includes tree-sitter support, =eglot= for LSP, and a much better default experience.

On macOS:
#+begin_src shell
brew install emacs-plus@30 --with-native-comp
#+end_src

On Fedora:
#+begin_src shell
sudo dnf install emacs
#+end_src

On Ubuntu:
#+begin_src shell
sudo snap install emacs --classic
#+end_src

*** The First 5 Things to Configure

Create =~/.emacs.d/init.el= (or =~/.config/emacs/init.el=) and add:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Clean up the UI
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)

;; Line numbers in programming modes
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'display-line-numbers-mode)

;; Remember recent files
(recentf-mode 1)

;; Save your place in files
(save-place-mode 1)

;; Don't litter the filesystem with backup files
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups")))
#+end_src

*** Install Your First Packages

Set up =use-package= (built-in since Emacs 29) and install the essentials:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Set up package archives
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Vertico — better minibuffer completion
(use-package vertico
  :ensure t
  :init (vertico-mode))

;; Marginalia — helpful annotations in the minibuffer
(use-package marginalia
  :ensure t
  :init (marginalia-mode))

;; Magit — the best Git interface
(use-package magit
  :ensure t
  :bind ("C-x g" . magit-status))
#+end_src

*** What's Next?

You now have a clean, modern Emacs with completion, Git integration, and a solid foundation. In the next article, we'll cover the 10 packages every new Emacs user should install.

** DONE The 10 Packages Every New Emacs User Should Install :emacs:packages:beginners:

The Emacs package ecosystem is vast — MELPA alone has over 5,000 packages. That's exciting but also overwhelming. Here are the 10 packages that give you the most value for the least configuration.

#+begin_export hugo
{{< youtube dQw4w9WxXcQ >}}
#+end_export

*** 1. Vertico

Modern, minimal vertical completion UI. Replaces the default minibuffer completion with something you'd actually want to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package vertico
  :ensure t
  :init (vertico-mode))
#+end_src

*** 2. Consult

Search and navigation commands that integrate with Vertico. =consult-ripgrep=, =consult-line=, and =consult-buffer= will change how you navigate code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package consult
  :ensure t
  :bind (("C-s" . consult-line)
         ("C-x b" . consult-buffer)
         ("M-g g" . consult-goto-line)))
#+end_src

*** 3. Marginalia

Adds helpful annotations next to completion candidates — file sizes, docstrings, keybindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package marginalia
  :ensure t
  :init (marginalia-mode))
#+end_src

*** 4. Orderless

Flexible completion matching. Type any part of what you're looking for in any order.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package orderless
  :ensure t
  :custom (completion-styles '(orderless basic)))
#+end_src

*** 5. Magit

The best Git interface ever made. Not an exaggeration. Once you use Magit, you'll never want to go back to the command line for Git.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package magit
  :ensure t
  :bind ("C-x g" . magit-status))
#+end_src

*** 6. Org-mode

Technically built-in, but worth mentioning because it's often why people come to Emacs in the first place. Notes, tasks, literate programming, and more.

*** 7. Which-key

Shows available keybindings in a popup. Essential for discoverability when you're learning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package which-key
  :ensure t
  :init (which-key-mode))
#+end_src

*** 8. Corfu

In-buffer completion popup. Fast, minimal, works with Eglot's LSP completions out of the box.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package corfu
  :ensure t
  :init (global-corfu-mode))
#+end_src

*** 9. Eglot

Built-in LSP client (since Emacs 29). Minimal configuration, just install a language server and go.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Eglot is built-in, just hook it up
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'rust-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
#+end_src

*** 10. Doom Themes

Even if you don't use Doom Emacs, the theme collection is excellent. =doom-one= and =doom-gruvbox= are crowd favorites.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-themes
  :ensure t
  :config
  (load-theme 'doom-one t))
#+end_src

*** Putting It All Together

All of these packages work together harmoniously. Vertico + Consult + Marginalia + Orderless form a completion framework that rivals anything in VS Code, and Magit + Org-mode are the power tools that keep experienced users on Emacs for decades.
